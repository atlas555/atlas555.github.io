      <description>Notes taken on Professor Xiaopeng Li â€™s class of CIV ENGR 679 Connected and Automated Transport, 2023Spring level 1: driver assistance. Only one assistance technology, mainly longitudinal. That is say, the car can control the gas pedal and the break pedal.
level 2: partial automation. Both longitudinal and lateral. That is to say, the car can control its steering wheel as well.
level 3: conditional automation. doing the same thing as level 2 but a little bit more reliable.</description>

      <title>Optimization: Standard Form</title>

      <description>Images in this posst came from the slides of CS524 at UW-Madison , 2023Spring This notebook runs in Julia and is rendered by Hupyter . The standard form of linear optimization problems is:
$$ \begin{align*} \underset{x\in \mathbb{R}^n}{\text{maximize}}\qquad&amp;amp; c^{T} x\\ \text{subject to:}\qquad&amp;amp; Ax \le b\\ &amp;amp; x \ge 0 \end{align*} $$
Transformation tricks Conversion between min and max: $min f(x) = - max(-f(x))$ $Ax &amp;gt;= b$ &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; $-Ax &amp;lt;= -b$ $f(x) = 0$ &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; $f(x) &amp;gt;= 0$ and $f(x) &amp;lt;= 0$ $x \in \mathbb{R} &amp;lt;=&amp;gt; u \ge 0, v \ge 0, x = u - v$ An example $$ \begin{align*} \underset{p, q}{\text{minimize}}\qquad&amp;amp; p + q\\ \text{subject to:}\qquad&amp;amp; 5p - 3q = 7\\ &amp;amp; 2p + q \ge 2 \\ &amp;amp; 1 \le q \le 4 \end{align*} $$</description>

      <title>What Do I Think About TED Talks</title>

      <description>TED talks say that they have ideas worth spreading, but I am not sure whether those ideas are worth listening.
Many people really like TED talks. These talks were and possibly still are very popular among Chinese students who regard TED talks as a valuable resource to learn English. In this aspect, I agree. TED is very helpful for English learners like me1. After all, most of the speakers are native speakers and their talks are very good for learners to practice listening and speaking.</description>
